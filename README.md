Select solutions to exercises from HPFFP

These are original solutions to some of the exercises from Allen and Moronuki's "Haskell Programming from First Principles".
The primary focus here is on writing typeclass instances for algebraic datatypes for many of Haskell's common
algebras-expressed-as-typeclasses including:

    # Functor
    # Applicative
    # Monad
    # Foldable
    # Traversable
    # Monoid
    # Semigroup

Also included are original exercises on typeclass instantiation written and solved for practice purposes.
